                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">By 1947, the Nationalist attack had stopped working. Even though they captured Yan'an in March 1947, the Nationalists' military advantage started falling apart. The Communist army (PLA) learned how to fight bigger battles while still using hit-and-run tactics, launching crushing counterattacks that eventually turned the war around.</p>
                
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-4 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Change in Tactics:</strong> The Communist army went from only hit-and-run attacks to big mobile battles, using both styles together really well.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nationalists Spread Too Thin:</strong> Nationalist forces were spread across way too much territory, unable to hold and supply all the areas they captured.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lin Biao's Leadership in Manchuria:</strong> This legendary general ran amazing campaigns that gave the Communists control of China's industrial heartland.</li>
                    <li><strong>Farmer Support:</strong> Communist land reform policies won huge support from countryside people, providing soldiers, supplies, and spy networks.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
                    <li><strong>Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Campaign (Jan-March 1947):</strong> The Communist army pushed back a major Nationalist attack, showing they had better teamwork and firepower.</li>
                    <li><strong>Capture of Yan'an (March 1947):</strong> The Nationalists took the symbolic Communist capital, but the Communist army's main forces got away safely and took it back later.</li>
                    <li><strong>Manchurian Attacks (Summer-Fall 1947):</strong> Lin Biao's forces launched counterattacks in the industrial northeast, eventually taking firm control of important cities like Harbin and Changchun.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shandong Peninsula Campaign (1947):</strong> The Communist army took control of this key region, cutting off Nationalist supply lines and trapping Nationalist forces in northern cities.</li>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-800 mb-3">Why the Nationalists Stopped Winning</h3>
                <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                    <li>• <strong>Supply Problems:</strong> Nationalist supply lines were way too long; troops in garrisons were isolated and easy targets for Communist ambushes and sieges.</li>
                    <li>• <strong>Inflation & Economic Collapse:</strong> Out-of-control Nationalist inflation destroyed soldiers' morale and made it hard to recruit new troops.</li>
                    <li>• <strong>Corruption & Bad Leadership:</strong> Useless Nationalist leadership wasted their advantages in numbers and equipment.</li>
                    <li>• <strong>Soviet Help for the Communists:</strong> Soviet control of Manchuria until early 1946, plus captured Japanese weapons, gave the Communist army better equipment.</li>
                    <li>• <strong>America Getting Tired:</strong> U.S. help to the Nationalists went down as American people turned against getting more involved in China.</li>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-purple-800 mb-3">How Mao & Lin Biao Changed Communist Strategy</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">The Communist army's success in 1947 came from mixing Mao's ideas about people's war with actual big battles:</p>
                <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                    <li>• <strong>Mobile Fighting:</strong> Large Communist units moved fast across huge distances, hitting Nationalist positions by surprise.</li>
                    <li>• <strong>Getting Everyone Involved:</strong> Farmers provided recruits, supplies, and information, creating an unstoppable advantage in resources.</li>
                    <li>• <strong>Gathering Forces:</strong> The Communist army learned to pile tons of troops against isolated Nationalist garrisons, then scatter before help arrived.</li>
                    <li>• <strong>Political Teaching:</strong> Communist political officers worked with armies, keeping discipline and commitment to the cause strong.</li>
