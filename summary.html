            <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                On October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong stood on top of Tiananmen Gate and announced the creation of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese Civil War started in 1927, stopped and started again, then went full-scale in 1945. The Communists won. Chiang Kai-shek and what was left of the Nationalist government ran away to Taiwan, where they set up a competing government that still exists today.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                This changed all the politics in East Asia, started the Cold War in Asia, and put China on a completely new path that affected hundreds of millions of people for many years.

            <div class="space-y-6">

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        The Communist army changed how they fought—from hit-and-run attacks to bigger battles. Lin Biao's attacks in Manchuria and the huge Huai-Hai Campaign showed they were better at moving supplies, getting information, and working together than the Nationalists.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        The Communists gave land to poor farmers, which made most of rural China support them. The Nationalists relied on rich landlords and city people. By actually giving land to the farmers, the Communists got tons of recruits and supplies from the countryside.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Money became worthless, which made city people lose faith in the Nationalists. Corrupt officials turned people against them. They tried to control too much area at once—both Manchuria and central China—which spread their army way too thin.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        The Soviets gave Japanese weapons to the Communists in Manchuria, and the U.S. mostly stopped sending military help to the Nationalists in 1948. America never totally abandoned them, but the U.S. wasn't really sure what to do, while Russia actively helped the Communists.

                        The People's Republic of China was created on October 1, 1949, with Beijing as the capital. The Communists controlled mainland China and started taking complete control through giving land to farmers, taking over businesses, and running political campaigns.

                        The Nationalist government ran to Taiwan and still claimed to be the real government of all China. This split created the "Taiwan question" that's still not solved today.

                        China joined up with the Soviet Union through a friendship treaty in 1950. Americans were really upset about "losing China" to communism, which made the Cold War in Asia even more tense.

            <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The Chinese Civil War was one of the most important conflicts of the 1900s. It decided the future of the world's most populated country and changed the direction of the Cold War, independence movements, and how Asian countries relate to each other.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The war's seven key phases—from the fight over Japanese territory right after WWII to the Nationalists' final defeat—show how military tactics, getting people to support you, money problems, and help from other countries all worked together to create a total revolution.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Understanding these turning points helps us see why China became what it is today and why this conflict still affects East Asian politics, Taiwan-China relations, and China's role in the world.
